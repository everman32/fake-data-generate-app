Application for generating fake user data

## Installation
Use `npm` as a package manager. Install dependencies from `package.json`:
```bash
npm i
```

## Usage
To start the application, you must run `npm run start` or simply `npm start`:
```bash
npm start
```
As mentioned earlier, the application generates fake user data and puts it in a table view. The table view contains the following data:
* `UUID` is a universal unique identifier that distinguishes records from each other,
* `Name` is the full name of the person (it may have a different format, since the data is generated from different regions),
* `Address` is the full address of the person's residence,
* `Phone` is the person's phone number (mobile or landline).

*Note: Name, Address and Phone may be in different format as the data is generated from different regions.*

### Infinite scroll
As the page scrolls to the end, 20 additional table entries are generated.

### Data sorting
The data in the table can be sorted by clicking on the column names. Initially, the data is presented "as is", that is, without sorting. Clicking on a column name will sort in ascending order ðŸ”¼ according to that particular column. Clicking again will sort in descending order ðŸ”½. If you click again, the data will be presented randomly.
